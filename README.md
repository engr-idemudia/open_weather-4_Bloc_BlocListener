# open_weather-4_Bloc_BlocListener

### Refactor Weather App using BlocListener for communication between Blocs.

The app uses async operations to fetch, read and display a location and weather-related data from a remote (OpenWeatherMap) API call.
The app has an input box for the user to type in a Location-name from the search icon, and to set the temperature scale reading to either degree celsius or Fahrenheit as required.
The app displays the city name and time, shows the weather temperature, also the theme of the app would display either dark or light based on a preset weather state, it also displays an icon to depict the present cloud condition of the chosen location.
